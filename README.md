# News Site

The assignment is to create a responsve site using flexbox and grid. The project will look like a classic magazine or a newspaper site, the header will contain a navbar with logo and name of the site, it will also look a sertain way depending on which device u use.

## The problem

I have tried to create simple html code, started in css with simple form to build the funktion and afterward created content. I have used internet to find soulutions to some of the problems I've encountered. I designed for mobile device and used media queries to "scale up" for tablet and desktop. I made my one logo and created a travel magazine called
Exiit Travle magazine "ETM".
I coded in VS Code but made some isolated test in codepen for ex the navbar.

If I had more time, I would probably build the site differently from the  beginning, since I've learnd so much during this project with trail and error. 
But primarily fix the images in a more correct size and fix so they fluently followed the frame. Insert a hamburger button for mobile design and fix the logo link and insert html code for reading possibilities. I would choose "better" pictures and review the design.
